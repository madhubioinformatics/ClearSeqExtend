**ClearSeqExtend: An Enhanced Toolkit for Ambient RNA Correction in scRNA-seq Data

ClearSeqExtend is an R package that provides ambient RNA correction and integrates advanced single-cell RNA-seq analysis functionalities from SeuratExtend. The package enables robust data correction, clustering, dimensionality reduction, and visualization, all designed for analyzing large-scale scRNA-seq datasets efficiently.

**ClearSeqExtend** is an R package designed to enhance single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data analysis by correcting for ambient RNA contamination and integrating advanced analysis functions from **SeuratExtend**. This package provides tools for robust normalization, dimensionality reduction (PCA, UMAP), clustering, and RNA velocity analysis, enabling researchers to uncover meaningful biological insights from their data.

## Key Features

- **Ambient RNA correction**: Efficiently removes ambient RNA contamination using sparse matrix operations.
- **SeuratExtend Integration**: Leverages advanced normalization, feature selection, and dimensionality reduction methods.
- **High-quality visualizations**: Create publication-ready UMAP, violin, and feature plots.
- **Clustering**: Identifies distinct cell populations using advanced clustering methods.
- **Customizable workflow**: Adapt the analysis pipeline to fit your specific research needs.


Installation
To install the ClearSeqExtend package, you'll first need to install the necessary dependencies and then install the package from GitHub:

r

# Install required packages
install.packages("devtools")
install.packages("Seurat")
install.packages("Matrix")

# Install ClearSeqExtend from GitHub
devtools::install_github("madhubioinformatics/ClearSeqExtend")
Loading the Package
After installation, load the ClearSeqExtend package along with Seurat and SeuratExtend:

r

# Load the libraries
library(Seurat)
library(SeuratExtend)
library(ClearSeqExtend)
Usage
This section walks you through how to use ClearSeqExtend for ambient RNA correction and advanced scRNA-seq analysis. We'll use a dataset (PBMC) from 10X Genomics for this example.

Load the Dataset and Create a Seurat Object
r

# Load your dataset (e.g., PBMC dataset)
pbmc_data <- Read10X_h5("path_to_data/10k_PBMC_3p_nextgem_Chromium_X_raw_feature_bc_matrix.h5")

# Create a Seurat object
seurat_obj <- CreateSeuratObject(counts = pbmc_data, project = "PBMC")
Run Ambient RNA Correction
You can correct for ambient RNA contamination using the clearseq_with_extend function, which is designed to handle sparse matrices efficiently:

r

# Perform ambient RNA correction with a threshold of 10 UMIs
seurat_obj <- clearseq_with_extend(seurat_obj, threshold = 10)
Common Pitfall: Make sure your dataset is in a sparse matrix format (dgCMatrix). Converting large datasets to a dense matrix may lead to memory allocation errors, especially for large scRNA-seq datasets.

Normalize the Data and Identify Variable Features
r

# Normalize the data using SeuratExtend's enhanced methods
seurat_obj <- enhanced_normalization(seurat_obj)

# Identify highly variable features
seurat_obj <- find_variable_features_extend(seurat_obj)
Pitfall: Forgetting to normalize your data before running PCA or UMAP can result in inaccurate results. Always normalize before performing dimensionality reduction.

Run PCA and UMAP
r

# Run PCA using SeuratExtend
seurat_obj <- run_pca_extend(seurat_obj)

# Run UMAP for dimensionality reduction
seurat_obj <- run_umap_extend(seurat_obj, dims = 1:10)
Pitfall: UMAP is highly sensitive to the number of dimensions selected. Make sure to adjust the number of dimensions appropriately based on your dataset size.

Clustering and Visualization
r

# Cluster the cells
seurat_obj <- cluster_cells_extend(seurat_obj, resolution = 0.5)

# Generate UMAP plot
umap_plot <- umap_plot_extend(seurat_obj)

# Display the UMAP plot
print(umap_plot)
Pitfall: Ensure that the resolution parameter in clustering is set appropriately. Too low or too high resolution can either over-cluster or under-cluster your data.
